	<description>
		Base class for all [BehaviorTree] composite tasks. You can create your own composite tasks by extending the BTComposite class.
		Composite is a control task within a [BehaviorTree] that contains one or more child tasks. It defines the structure and flow of the [BehaviorTree] by specifying how child tasks are executed. Composites can be used to group related tasks into a single unit, making it easier to manage and maintain the [BehaviorTree]. Examples of [BehaviorTree] composites include [BTSelector], [BTSequence], and [BTParallel].
