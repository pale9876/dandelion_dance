	<description>
		BTRandomSequence executes its child tasks in a random order as long as they return [code]SUCCESS[/code]. If a child task results in [code]SUCCESS[/code], BTRandomSequence will immediately execute the next child task until one of them returns [code]FAILURE[/code] or all of them result in [code]SUCCESS[/code].
		Returns [code]RUNNING[/code] if a child task results in [code]RUNNING[/code]. BTRandomSequence will remember the execution order and the last child task that returned [code]RUNNING[/code], ensuring it resumes from that point in the next tick.
		Returns [code]FAILURE[/code] if a child task results in [code]FAILURE[/code].
		Returns [code]SUCCESS[/code] if all child tasks result in [code]SUCCESS[/code].
