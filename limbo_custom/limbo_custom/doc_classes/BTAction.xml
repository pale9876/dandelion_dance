	<description>
		Base class for all actions within a [BehaviorTree]. You can create your own actions by extending the [BTAction] class.
		Represents a specific behavior or action in a [BehaviorTree] that an agent should execute. Actions are the lowest level of the [BehaviorTree] hierarchy and are responsible for performing the actual work required to achieve a goal. Actions do not have child tasks.
		A single action can perform a task within one or multiple ticks. If it takes more than one tick to complete the task, the action should return [code]RUNNING[/code] status. When the task is finished, the action returns either [code]SUCCESS[/code] or [code]FAILURE[/code] to indicate the outcome.
