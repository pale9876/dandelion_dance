		BTDynamicSelector executes its child tasks sequentially, from first to last, until any child returns [code]SUCCESS[/code]. Unlike [BTSelector], it will execute tasks from the beginning every tick, reevaluating their statuses. It is quite useful when you want to retry higher-priority behaviors in every tick.
		Returns [code]RUNNING[/code] if a child task results in [code]RUNNING[/code]. BTDynamicSelector will remember the last [code]RUNNING[/code] child, but, unlike [BTSequence], on the next execution tick, it will reexecute preceding tasks and reevaluate their return statuses. If any of the preceding tasks doesn't result in [code]FAILURE[/code], it will abort the remembered [code]RUNNING[/code] task.
		Returns [code]FAILURE[/code] if all child tasks result in [code]FAILURE[/code].
		Returns [code]SUCCESS[/code] if a child task results in [code]SUCCESS[/code].
